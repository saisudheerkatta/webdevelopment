The next big thing is Artificial Intelligence. We’ve worked on 40 Million call recordings to train our machine learning and we are now able to instantly know if a customer is happy or not. Very soon we will help agents with contextualized suggestions, or automate actions based on the conversation contents.","visionDesc2":"Due to the Telephony element in our service, our value proposition is particularly strong in Emerging countries. After the launch of ZIWO back in 2017 in the UAE, we deployed our network in the GCC countries.
